Who Am I? 🙋‍♀️

👩‍💼 A 32-year-old working as an Airbnb Property Manager.

🇧🇷🇮🇹 I was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and I'm half-Italian.

🛫 I love traveling, hiking, movies, sports-related activities, and learning.

👩‍🎓 In 2015, I graduated with a Bachelor of Exercise and Sports Science.

🇲🇾 Then, I got hired for a job in Malaysia, where I lived for a couple of years working with sports.

🏜️ I met my husband in Arizona, and we've been married since 2019.

🐶 We have a small Jack-Russel named Peppy — super cute, by the way! :)

🌲 And we're currently living in South Carolina.

Since last year, my thoughts and professional desires have shifted, and I've leaned toward the tech field. I started learning how to code through a BootCamp at Maricopa Community College. It was a great experience, but I wanted something more.

📊 Now, I'm pursuing my Data Analytics certificate through Google, and I can say that it's been a fun journey. I'm excited to share more of my path with you!
